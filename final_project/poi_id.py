### Task 1: Select what features you'll use.
### features_list is a list of strings, each of which is a feature name.
### The first feature must      sbe "poi".
features_list = ['poi','long term incentive','deferral income','deferral payments','restricted stock deferred'] # You will need to use more features

### Load the dictionary containing the dataset
with open("final_project_dataset.pkl", "r") as data_file:
    data_dict = pickle.load(data_file)

### Task 2: Remove outliers
data_dict.pop('Total','THE TRAVEL AGENCY IN THE PARK')
### Task 3: Create new feature(s)
def new_features(total payments,total stock value):
    new_list=[]
    for i in data_dict:
        if data_dict[i][total payments]=="NaN"or data_dict[i][total payments]==0:
            new_list.append(0)
        else
            new_list.append(data_dict[i][total stock value]/data_dict[i][total payments])
    return new_list

### Store to my_dataset for easy export below.
my_dataset = data_dict

### Extract features and labels from dataset for local testing
data = featureFormat(my_dataset, features_list, sort_keys = True)
labels, features = targetFeatureSplit(data)

### Task 4: Try a varity of classifiers
### Please name your classifier clf for easy export below.
### Note that if you want to do PCA or other multi-stage operations,
### you'll need to use Pipelines. For more info:
### http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/pipeline.html

# Provided to give you a starting point. Try a variety of classifiers.
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
clfNB = GaussianNB()
from sklearn.svm import svm
clfSV = SVC(kernel = "linear")

### Task 5: Tune your classifier to achieve better than .3 precision and recall
### using our testing script. Check the tester.py script in the final project
### folder for details on the evaluation method, especially the test_classifier
### function. Because of the small size of the dataset, the script uses
### stratified shuffle split cross validation. For more info:
### http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cross_validation.StratifiedShuffleSplit.html

# Example starting point. Try investigating other evaluation techniques!
from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split
features_train, features_test, labels_train, labels_test = \
    train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
clfNB.fit(features_test,labels_train)
pred=clfNB.predict(features_test)
clfSV.fit(features_train,labels_train)
pred=clfSV.predict(features_test)

### Task 6: Dump your classifier, dataset, and features_list so anyone can
### check your results. You do not need to change anything below, but make sure
### that the version of poi_id.py that you submit can be run on its own and
### generates the necessary .pkl files for validating your results.
